# Hack-Repolert

## Overview

This was a project for the Firstnet Public Safety [Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/firstnet-public-safety-hackathon-san-francisco-tickets-42037952648#) on March 23-24 in San Francisco, CA at Covo. 

## Tools my team used: 

[Esri](http://www.esri.com/arcgis/about-arcgis) - Work Smarter With ArcGIS - The Mapping & Analytics Platform

“ArcGIS provides contextual tools for mapping and spatial reasoning so you can explore data and share location-based insights. ArcGIS creates deeper understanding, allowing you to quickly see where things are happening and how information is connected.” 

[IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-language-understanding/) - Natural Language Understanding - Natural language processing for advanced text analysis.

“Uncover insights from structured and unstructured data. Analyze text to extract meta-data from content such as concepts, entities, keywords, categories, relations and semantic roles.”

## Problem we were solving: 

Something **NEW** happened - Where did it happen? How severe is it?

We named our app “First Alert” because that is THE most important alert a first responder receives. In fact, it is the only alert that is needed outside of eye witness accounts.

First responders receive massive amounts of calls when people witness or see an event happen. However, responders only need information that is both **new** and from **witnesses** once the initial event has been reported. Our app would not alert responders incidence that have taken place (by showing an alert/pin on their responder dashboard map), the app would also alert the public as well (on the newsfeed public version of the app). 

The goal is to create communication between the responders and public to ensure witnesses are accounted for and resources are properly distributed. Witnesses are able to update the alert with new information as needed. 

Ideally, this app would become a default app on android devices. It is intended to be used on broader issues that affect the public at large versus individual cases. This is not meant to eliminate 911 but instead serve as a communication tool between witnesses and first responders, alleviating the clog of phone calls.
